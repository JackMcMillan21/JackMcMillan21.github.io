                <h2>Importance And Process</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS are very important in the production of a website. Files and folders work together to
                    build the webpages you see everyday, a lot of file management is required when working with CSS and
                    HTML. You can think of HTML as the foundation of a building while CSS is the paint and furniture
                    that is used to make it look good. When first starting with a web development project you need to
                    identify what core syntax is required just to have somewhere to put your data. This is commonly
                    identified as the head and the body. Every page that you have ever seen has had information in the
                    head and body and I will go into more depth shortly on why that is.
                </p>
                <h2>How The Head Works</h2>
                <p>In the head you commonly find the same few lines of code across all webpages. These
                    few lines are the character set, the compatibility across web browsers, the scale of the website
                    across mobile devices, and much more. The character set syntax is used to make sure that all the
                    characters are available to be used within the web page and across all web browsers,
                    (compatibility syntax). The most common is UTF-8, which can encode 1,112,064 valid
                    characters. CSS also has relation to the head when importing style sheets and other styling. CSS
                    style sheets are like HTML files, but they are used to change the HTML itself, to make, or do a
                    specific thing. The last portion of HTML that is most commonly used is the body, which usually holds
                    all of the content within the page that you see.
                </p>
                <h2>More About HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for cascading style sheets, which is a styling language that is used to create designs
                    using text (code). As stated earlier it is a way of styling foundational items to make them look a
                    specific way. Just like a painting, there is an endless amount of skills to be applied to your HTML
                    and almost any idea can be created with the use of CSS. CSS varies from centering a container in the
                    middle of the screen to scaling to any number of screen sizes, animating an object across the screen
                    etc. Although after reading this you may feel you have a great understanding of the idea, I am just
                    nearly scratching the surface of this very interesting topic.
