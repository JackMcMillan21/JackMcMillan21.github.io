                    <h2>Find a template of design you would like to carve</h2>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way of making sure you have
                        the best possible outcome for your pumpkin is by following a design/template. There are plenty
                        of
                        templates online that are easily printable and can be either traced or taped onto the side of
                        the
                        pumpkin to make it easy to carve without making a mistake.

                    <h2>Purchase pumpkins that are an appropriate size for design</h2>
                    <p>Pumpkin size is very
                        important, so
                        try to find one that fits the dimensions of your design and that can stand up on its own. (Some
                        people
                        recommend purchasing one that has a flat side making it easy to carve and write on.)

                    <h2>Prepping pumpkin</h2>
                    <p> Prepping the pumpkin is an essential step in making the pumpkin carving
                        process as easy as possible. You start with carving a circle around the stem of the pumpkin at a
                        45°
                        angle
                        to ensure that the stem does not fall inside of the pumpkin when you cut out the stem. Next, you
                        want to take out all of the seeds and “guts” inside of the pumpkin. Lastly, it is recommended to
                        carve a small layer off the sides of the walls of the pumpkin so that it is cleaner, and can
                        glow
                        easier in the dark when a candle is placed inside.

                <div class="content content-4">
                    <h2>Drawing or taping the design on</h2>
                    <p> This step is not mandatory but is recommended a majority
                        of
                        the time. By either drawing or taping your design onto the side of the pumpkin you are making
                        the
                        carving process a lot easier to follow and reduces the chances of mistakes.

                <div class="content content-5">
                    <h2>Carving out your design</h2>
                    <p> Find a sharp knife and use a gentle back and forth motion along
                        the
                        line of your design until you reach a corner of the design. When cutting around corners you
                        should
                        remove
                        your knife from the pumpkin and stab back into it in the intended direction to avoid round
                        edges/corners. If a piece of the pumpkin does not fall out immediately when finishing cutting,
                        you
                        can stick your hand in the top of the pumpkin and push it out from the inside.

                    <h2>Lighting up your pumpkin</h2>
                    <p> Lastly, find a candle or plastic fake candle and place it inside of your pumpkin.
                        Put the top on top of the pumpkin, turn off the lights, and you have your finished, carved, pumpkin!

                    <p>
                        Lastly, a little bonus tip that can be used to have a fun snack is seasoning and cooking the
                        pumpkin seeds in the oven. It calls for a good thing to nibble on throughout the night.
                        Now that you are a master of pumpkin carving, you can always be prepared to impress your friends
                        and family with your new skills!
