                    <h2>Web Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web security is a very broad statement and covers a lot of different areas and expertise, but
                        they all come down to the same thing, keeping the user's information private when on a webpage.
                        You probably found this article because you noticed the little lock icon at the top of your
                        webpage and now you want to know what it's all about. The lock icon itself just means that the
                        webpage is being run through a secure port on the router and that it uses an SSL certificate.
                        This may sound like gibberish at the moment but it is a lot simpler than it seems.

                    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let’s first talk about what HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is, and how it is vital
                        to keeping your information private on a website. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transfer
                        data over a network. The data/information is transferred on a specific port on the router (443)
                        that ensures data security, and proper encryption. In simplest terms, this means that when you
                        input your data onto a website the information is taking the safest route to the destination.
                        This transfer protocol is very reliable and is very secure in comparison to something like HTTP
                        ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which is sent in cleartext. This means that any information that
                        is being sent on a website running only HTTP can be intercepted and easily stolen or understood.
                        Using HTTPS is just ½ of the lock icon you see at the top of your page. (↓ Showing Difference in

                    <h2>SSL</h2>
                    <p>
                        The other half of the security on a webpage is the use of an SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
                        certificate. An SSL certificate is a type of digital certificate (DC) that substantiates a
                        website, and in turn, enables an encrypted internet connection between the two services that
                        would be connected. ie) Host to host, server to server, and host to server. In simplest terms,
                        this means that when you try to connect to a web service, your system checks for an SSL
                        certificate which, if present, enables all of your information to be transferred securely over
                        the internet. It is very similar to HTTPS but it has more to do with the internet connection you
                        have and not the sending of information on the web service. You may also be asking what a
                        digital certificate is. A DC is a file or type of password that makes sure a device, server, or
                        user is reliable and does not have hostile intentions. Websites use DC’s to prove authenticity
                        and security to a user. (↓ Showing how digital certificate makes a web connection secure ↓)

                        Although these topics may seem difficult to grasp and seem like a lot of information, these are
                        just
                        the top of the barrel when it comes to web security and data transfer security. At least now you
                        know the two things that make up a majority of web pages. Now when one of your friends asks what
                        the
                        little lock icon is for at the top of the page you'll be an expert who can explain what SSL and
                        HTTPS is.
