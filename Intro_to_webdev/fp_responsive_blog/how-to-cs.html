                    <h2>The skill of csing and how to use it</h2>
                    <p> Csing is a fundamental skill of every league of legends match
                        and can help you climb the ranks fast. Creep score is most commonly referred to as cs every time
                        you
                        kill any type of monster on the map that earns you gold. You can earn cs in one of the core
                        lanes,
                        top, mid, or bottom. These minions will walk into your lane naturally and automatically attack
                        your
                        minions or you if there is none. You can also earn cs by killing jungle monsters that are
                        located in
                        between the lanes. Note that some jungle monsters earn you more cs than others.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to cs in lane</h2>
                    <p> First, let's talk about csing in the lane. When it comes to csing in lane there
                        are three different types of minions that can earn you gold:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Melee minions, medium health enemies that automatically attack champions, minions and
                            towers.
                            These
                            earn you 21 gold when killed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Caster minions, low health enemies that automatically attack champions, minions and towers.
                            These earn you 16 gold when killed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cannon minions, high health enemies that automatically attack champions, minions and towers.
                            These earn you 75 gold when killed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="content-2-p">
                        <p>
                            Your main goal is to make sure you are “last hitting” the minions in order to earn cs. Last
                            hitting
                            is when you deal the final amount of damage to the minion to ensure you get the kill, which
                            in
                            turn
                            makes sure you get the cs. You also need to make sure you know how to “farm under tower”.
                            Farming
                            under tower is when the tower does a significant amount of damage to a minion so you need to
                            make
                            sure you leave it at a certain health so that you can quickly last hit after the tower deals
                            that
                            amount of damage to the minion.
                        </p>

                    <div class="image-2"></div>

                <div class="content content-3">
                    <h2>How to cs in the jungle</h2>
                    <p> Another way to cs is by killing the different types of jungle monsters in
                        between the lanes. Regardless if you are not playing the jungle role you should still be aware
                        of
                        the cs benefits of the jungle. This is in case you need to kill them as a laner to earn some
                        extra
                        gold. There are different jungle monsters on the map that can earn you cs. These consist of:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Raptors (six minions), five small low health minions, and one larger minion. Killing the
                            entire
                            camp earns you forty-five gold or two cs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Boulders (eight minions), two large, high health minions, that turn into four medium health
                            minions when killed. Killing the entire camp earns you ninety-five gold or four cs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gromp (one minion), one large high health minion, that gives back health to the champion
                            when
                            killed. Killing the entire camp earns you ninety-one gold or four cs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wolves (three minions), three medium low health minions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Blue buff, one large high health minion, that gives you extra cooldown reduction and mana
                            regen
                            when killed. Killing the entire camp earns you one hundred and five gold or 5 cs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Red buff, one large high health minion, that gives you extra damage and health regen when
                            killed. Killing the entire camp earns you one hundred and five gold or five cs.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What you should focus on</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is just the overview of csing and there is still much more to learn.
                        Over the years there have been players that have climbed the ranks strictly by increasing their
                        csing skills because it plays such a big role in the gold advantage you can build over your
                        opponent. Therefore I recommend focusing on this skill and taking a look at some other resources
                        to
                        learn all of the different tips and tricks. There are over 100 champions in league of legends
                        that
                        can all affect how you cs throughout the game in different ways. The best way to get an idea of
                        how
                        this all works is to simply play the game casually and try to understand the basics.
