                        The goal of this article is to help you understand how to best work the parts of your chest to
                        increase mass and volume. The chest is separated into 3 different parts; upper, middle, and
                        lower. A majority of the time the exercises you do focus on 2 of the 3 groups so you don't need
                        to work the muscle groups individually. Depending on your experience with resistance training
                        when starting with chest exercises you should try the lowest weight and run through the motions
                        to better understand what your limits are.

                    <h2>Upper Chest</h2>
                    <p>The upper chest, or clavicular head, can be focused in a series of exercises. Regardless of
                        whether you have been in the gym for a long time, or just starting, everyone can have
                        difficulties building the upper chest if not doing it right. If you were to ask any bodybuilder
                        the key to building an upper chest they would say, incline bench and chest flys. That is correct
                        but to some extent, these exercises hyper-focus on the muscle fibers which come with high risk
                        because if done incorrectly can cause extreme injuries. The best, safe, exercises consist of
                        low-to-high cable raises, converging incline machine press, and dumbbell incline press. </p>

                    <h2>Lower Chest</h2>
                    <p>
                        The lower chest can be ignored in a lot of people's workouts because they are too focused on the
                        shape. Although this is true the lower chest or costal head makes up a majority of the muscle in
                        the pectoralis major. Almost any motion that lifts something in front of your body uses a
                        portion of the lower chest. Therefore it should never be skipped in a workout due to it being
                        used so much. If you are at home you can do exercises like incline pushups or parallel dips on
                        pieces of furniture. If you have access to a gym some other alternatives would be decline
                        barbell bench press or cable crossovers.

                        In conclusion, the chest is a series of very complicated muscles that are very commonly
                        misinterpreted. If you're going strictly for shape and size, the upper and middle chest is where
                        you want to be training. The negative of this would be that you would be losing out on a lot of
                        mass and strength in your lower chest. If it were up to me I would put everyone on an even
                        workout with safe exercises. This would help people build both mass, volume, and build muscle in
                        moderation. So you can always look amazing and feel confident too!
