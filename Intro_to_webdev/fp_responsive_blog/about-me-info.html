                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Jack McMillan, here you will find an autobiography of me and what I am all about.
                        I grew up towards the south side of Winnipeg spending most of my time with friends and family
                        and a majority of the summers in the small town of Roblin where my grandparents live. Roblin has
                        always been a safe place for me to escape the city and do things I normally can’t do. My summer
                        days would be filled with swimming in the lake, quading with family on the endless acres of
                        land, taking walks down to the bakery to pick up the freshly made donuts etc. But during the
                        month of November, the week following remembrance day is one of my favorite times of year
                        because it is hunting season. It has always been a tradition for members of the McMillan family
                        to come “home” during this week for the signature hunt. This is a great way for the family to
                        see each other each year.
                    </p>

                    <h2>My Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        I enrolled in my current software development program in 2019 but I was interested in the topic
                        far before then. I have always been attentive to all things technology as I grew up, for
                        example: building my first Personal Computer in just 2019, working with my school to go to
                        tech-related events, and working every day to create 3D models to print in my school's library.
                        So when the opportunity came across me to join a program to finish high school with a college
                        degree in something I loved, I jumped on it. The reason I love technology so much is that it is
                        always adapting and evolving as time goes on. If you take a step back and see the growth and
                        progress of just the cell phone over the last 15 years it is far faster than other fields in the
                        past.

                    <h2>Passions</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am very passionate about solving problems and making harder tasks easier for future
                        generations in any way I can. There are so many opportunities available and problems that can be
                        solved with the use of technology, that's why I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring and help
                        with this growing idea so that my children won't struggle with the same problems that I do
                        today. I try to take every opportunity I can do to do the things I love because they keep my
                        mental performance at its peak. Some of my hobbies are volleyball, golfing, fishing, playing
                        online games with friends and going to the gym. A Lot of people find it hard to have the
                        motivation to go to the gym but the best trick is to have someone to go with. There are a lot of
                        times I am sitting at home and my gym partner gives me a call, he keeps me healthy and happy.
